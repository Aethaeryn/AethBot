In general:
 * Separate the irclogs into different files per channel, and queries.

AethBot.py:
 * Enable ssl. This may require rewriting it to get rid of ircbot dependency.
   * This is probably preferable if it can get rid of the mess of inherited on_foobar functions.

core.py:
 * Make sure only successful joins/parts are logged; handle properly!

commands.py
 * Allow a way to modify stuff in the config files from the bot itself.
 * Include a check that the operator is identified with nickserv.
 * Create a separate help syntax, like ~ and ,
 * No quit message is displayed on , quit.

calc.py:
 * This is old. Review how it works.
 * Add a help command.

federation.py:
 * Write code that makes it aware of Federation so that it can be used as an IRC bot to issue Federation moves.
