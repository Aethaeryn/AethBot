In general:
 * Provide more extensive configuration system. Anything that is variable should go here.
 * Use yaml configs.
 * Put AethBot in multiple channels, adding #federation and #federation-dev
 * Separate the irclogs into different files per channel, and queries.

AethBot.py:
 * Enable ssl. This may require rewriting it to get rid of ircbot dependency.
 * This is probably preferable to get rid of the mess of inherited on_foobar functions.
 * Find way to automatically run in the background on run. (GNU screen?)

core.py:
 * Put self.operators into a config file to read from, and include a check that the operator is logged in.
 * Allow a way to modify stuff in the config files from the bot itself.

botmath.py:
 * This is old. Review how it works. Maybe (especially?) the debug main() thing.

federation.py:
 * Write code that makes it aware of Federation so that it can be used as an IRC bot to issue Federation moves.
